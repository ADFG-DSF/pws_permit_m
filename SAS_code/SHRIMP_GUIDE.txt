All permit analysis code/files are located at

Prince William Sound Shrimp
Primary Contact/Biologist: Jay Baumer

Raw Data:
pwspmc_2020 - this is a file containing all registers permits
pwshvc_2020 - this is the file containing all harvest records
These files get sent to you via email from a database manager.


Permit response codes: 
0 - responded before any reminder
1 responded after 1st reminder
2 responded after 2nd reminder
9 never responded

Goal: Determine how much shrimp was harvested using people who responded after 
the 2nd reminder as represenative of the non-respondants

*************************
Running the estimates script might not be needed, compare with harvest as it is very similar
*************************

SAS Files:
Run "Permits" File first -- Creats permit summary
Run "Harvest" second -- summarizes reported harvest
Run "Estimates" third --- estimates the total harvest which includes estimates of non-respondant harvests


Stat Area Problems:

Each year Jay Baumer goes through the reported stat areas and corrects them. Usually there are quite a few errors.
He will send you a file with the correct stat areas.
I believe this file has the correct stat area for each observation,
so you can replace the original reported stat areas with the corrected ones. (no error matching/replacement)

All SAS scripts output their summaries to a "Shrimp Permits 20XX" files, which is the final document
to be sent back to Jay Baumer.

To do a new analysis:

Copy Permits, Harvest, and Estimates scripts to new folder. Add the raw data files to the folder.
Change the file locations and years in the scripts, and then run. Some years the raw data format
changes, and thats the only time the code needs to be adapted.
